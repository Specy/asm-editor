Alright, let's take a more formal look at the fundamental arithmetic operations available in our instruction set. Understanding these tools is crucial for building more complex logic.

## Core Arithmetic Operations

We have a set of essential instructions that allow us to perform basic arithmetic: addition (`ADD`), subtraction (`SUB`), multiplication (`MULS`, `MULU`), division (`DIVS`, `DIVU`), negation (`NEG`), and clearing a value to zero (`CLR`). Each of these serves a specific purpose in manipulating numerical data.

### Addition: Combining Values

The `ADD` instruction performs the fundamental operation of adding two operands. The syntax generally follows the pattern:

```m68k
ADD.<size> <source>, <destination>
```

Here, `<size>` specifies the data size being operated on (e.g., `.B` for byte, `.W` for word, `.L` for longword). The `<source>` operand is added to the `<destination>` operand, and the result is stored back in the `<destination>`.

Consider these examples:

```m68k|playground
ADD.W D0, D1      ; Add the 16-bit value in D0 to the 16-bit value in D1, store in D1
ADD.B #5, D3      ; Add the immediate 8-bit value 5 to the lowest byte of D3
ADD.L (A0), D2    ; Add the 32-bit value at the memory address in A0 to D2
ADD.L D4, (A1)    ; Add the 32-bit value in D4 to the memory at address A1
```

During the execution of an `ADD` instruction, the CPU's condition code register is updated to reflect the outcome of the operation. The flags that are typically affected include:

- **Zero flag (Z):** Set if the result of the addition is zero.
- **Negative flag (N):** Set if the most significant bit of the result is set (indicating a negative value in signed arithmetic).
- **Overflow flag (V):** Set if a signed overflow occurred (the result is outside the representable range for the given size).
- **Carry flag (C):** Set if a carry-out occurred from the most significant bit, useful for multi-precision arithmetic.

### Address Addition: Adjusting Memory Pointers

The `ADDA` instruction is specifically designed for adding to the contents of address registers. Its syntax is similar to `ADD`:

```m68k
ADDA.<size> <source>, <address_register>
```

A key distinction of `ADDA` is that it does not affect the condition code register. It is purely for address manipulation.

Example:

```m68k
ADDA.L #4, A0    ; Increment the address in A0 by 4 bytes
```

This is commonly used when iterating through data structures in memory.

### Quick Addition: Efficient Increments

For adding small immediate values (in the range of 1 to 8), the `ADDQ` instruction provides a more efficient way to increment a register or memory location:

```m68k
ADDQ.<size> #<data>, <destination>
```

Example:

```m68k
ADDQ.L #1, D0    ; Increment the longword in D0 by 1
```

`ADDQ` generally executes faster and occupies less memory than the equivalent `ADD` instruction with an immediate operand.

### Subtraction: Determining the Difference

The `SUB` instruction subtracts the source operand from the destination operand, storing the result in the destination:

```m68k
SUB.<size> <source>, <destination>
```

The order of operands is crucial: `destination = destination - source`.

Examples:

```m68k|playground
SUB.W D2, D3      ; Subtract the 16-bit value in D2 from D3, store in D3
SUB.L #1000, D4  ; Subtract the immediate 32-bit value 1000 from D4
SUB.B D0, (A0)   ; Subtract the 8-bit value in D0 from the byte at memory address A0
```

Similar to `ADD`, `SUB` updates the condition code register. For subtraction:

- **Zero flag (Z):** Set if the result is zero.
- **Negative flag (N):** Set if the result is negative.
- **Overflow flag (V):** Set if a signed overflow occurred.
- **Carry flag (C):** In subtraction, the Carry flag acts as a borrow flag. It is set if a borrow was required during the operation (i.e., if the source operand was larger than the destination operand when considering unsigned values).

### Address Subtraction: Moving Backward in Memory

The `SUBA` instruction is the counterpart to `ADDA` and is used to subtract from address registers:

```m68k
SUBA.<size> <source>, <address_register>
```

Like `ADDA`, `SUBA` does not affect the condition code register.

Example:

```m68k
SUBA.W #64, A1   ; Decrement the address in A1 by 64 bytes
```

This is commonly used when working with stack data structures or traversing data in reverse.

### Quick Subtraction: Efficient Decrements

The `SUBQ` instruction provides an optimized way to subtract small immediate values (1 to 8) from a register or memory location:

```m68k
SUBQ.<size> #<data>, <destination>
```

Example:

```m68k
SUBQ.W #8, D7    ; Subtract 8 from the word in D7
```

`SUBQ` offers similar performance and size benefits over the equivalent `SUB` instruction.

### Multiplication: Calculating Products

Examples:

```m68k|playground
MULS D1, D2    ; Multiply the signed word in D1 by the signed word in D2, result in D2 (longword)
MULU #42, D3   ; Multiply the unsigned word in D3 by the unsigned immediate value 42, result in D3 (longword)
```

The condition code register is affected by multiplication operations.

### Division: Obtaining Quotients and Remainders

Division is performed using the `DIVS` (signed) and `DIVU` (unsigned) instructions:

```m68k
DIVS.W <divisor>, <dividend>
DIVU.W <divisor>, <dividend>
```

Here, the `<dividend>` is a longword (32-bit) in a data register, and the `<divisor>` is a word (16-bit). After the division, the lower word of the `<dividend>` register contains the quotient, and the upper word contains the remainder.

Example:

```m68k
DIVU.W #10, D0   ; Divide the longword in D0 by the unsigned word 10. Quotient in D0.Wl, remainder in D0.Wh
```

It is crucial to avoid division by zero, as this will lead to a processor exception.

### Negation: Inverting the Sign

The `NEG` instruction performs two's complement negation on the operand:

```m68k
NEG.<size> <destination>
```

This effectively changes the sign of a signed number.

Example:

```m68k
NEG.L D0         ; Replace the longword in D0 with its two's complement (negation)
```

The condition code register is updated based on the result of the negation.

### Clear: Setting to Zero

The `CLR` instruction provides a straightforward way to set the value of a register or memory location to zero:

```m68k
CLR.<size> <destination>
```

Example:

```m68k|playground
CLR.W D5         ; Set the word in D5 to zero
```

This is often more efficient than moving an immediate zero value.

## Practical Application

Understanding how these arithmetic instructions function individually is the first step. The true power comes from combining them to perform more complex calculations and implement algorithms.

Consider the questions posed earlier:

1.  **Calculating the average of three numbers:** This would involve using `ADD` to sum the three numbers and then `DIVU` to divide the sum by three. Careful consideration of data sizes is important to avoid overflow during the summation and to handle potential remainders in the division.

2.  **Multiplying by 16 without `MULS`/`MULU`:** Multiplying by powers of 2 can be efficiently achieved using left bit shifts. A left shift by one bit is equivalent to multiplying by 2. Therefore, multiplying by 16 (which is $2^4$) can be done by performing a left shift operation four times. We will explore bit manipulation instructions in a subsequent discussion.

3.  **Determining if a number is odd or even:** The bitwise AND operation is particularly useful here. An odd number has its least significant bit set to 1, while an even number has it set to 0. By performing a bitwise AND with the value 1, the result will be 1 if the number is odd and 0 if it's even. We will delve into logical and bitwise operations later.

The provided playground code demonstrates a sequence of these arithmetic operations. Experimenting with different values and observing the changes in the registers will solidify your understanding of these fundamental tools. As we progress, we will see how these basic building blocks can be combined to create sophisticated programs.
