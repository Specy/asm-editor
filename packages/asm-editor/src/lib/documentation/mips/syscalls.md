## Asking the simulator for a service

`syscall` asks this simulator to perform one of its services; it does not call an operating system in the simulated machine. Put the service number in `$v0`, then put its arguments in the registers listed in that service's entry. For example, service 1 prints the integer in `$a0`:

```mips
# Load the integer 42 into register $a0, which is
# the register that will be printed by the syscall
li $a0, 42
# Set the syscall code for printing an integer
li $v0, 1
syscall
```

A C or C++ program reaches the same services through `<sim.h>`. Each entry names its function in **From C**; `sim_print_int(42);` performs the same service.

## Sound {#sound}

Services 31 and 33 play a note with a pitch, instrument, volume, and duration in milliseconds. Service 31 starts the note and continues immediately, so notes started close together can overlap to make a chord. Service 33 waits for the requested duration before the next instruction, which lets a sequence of notes keep time as a melody. Notes finish their duration even if the program exits; **Stop** or a new Build stops them.

For programmable waveforms and sample playback, this editor adds the [Synth](/documentation/mips/synth), a sound chip whose registers are memory at `0xffff0100`. MARS does not have it.

Pitch numbers run from 0 to 127. Each increase of 1 moves up a semitone: one piano-key step, counting both white and black keys. For example, 60 is middle C, 62 is D, 64 is E, 67 is G, and 72 is the C one octave above middle C.

General MIDI is a standard list of instrument sounds. These services number instruments from **0** to 127: 0 is acoustic grand piano, 40 is violin, 56 is trumpet, and 73 is flute. No MIDI file or external instrument is needed. Volume runs from 0 (silent) to 127 (loudest).

The editor supplies a General MIDI sound bank, a collection of instrument sounds. The browser loads it automatically when the editor page first plays a note or MIDI file, so that first request waits for loading. The bank is shared across program runs and projects until the page is reloaded.

After a program requests sound, the **Sound** button appears in the execution dock as a mute/unmute control. It sets **Play sound** in **Preferences**, where **Sound volume** is also available. Both settings apply across projects. Muting leaves program-visible timing and results unchanged.

This editor differs from MARS in two ways:

- At most 64 notes sound at once, where MARS has no limit. Starting another stops the oldest.
- Testcases are silent. Service 33 still waits for the requested duration on the testcase's virtual clock, so the wait completes immediately and advances that clock.

## Program arguments {#arguments}

Enter **Arguments** on the Terminal's first line, the **Command line**, or in the project's **Settings** panel. They take effect at the next Build; during a Debug session, the line shows what the current run started with. Stop the Debug session to edit the Command line. Arguments are startup strings, separate from text the program reads later through Terminal input.

A Testcase can supply its own **Arguments**. An empty or whitespace-only field inherits the project's Arguments, so it cannot request an empty argument list while project Arguments are set.

### Entering argument strings

The field uses these quoting rules:

- Whitespace separates arguments unless quoted or escaped.
- Single quotes (`'two words'`) and double quotes (`"two words"`) keep text in one argument. The quote marks are removed; `''` and `""` each create an empty argument.
- Outside quotes, a backslash takes the next character literally: `two\ words` is one argument. A trailing backslash stays a backslash.
- Inside single quotes, every character is literal, including a backslash. Inside double quotes, a backslash escapes only a double quote, backslash, dollar sign, or backtick; before other characters it remains a backslash.
- Adjacent quoted and unquoted parts form one argument: `pre"two words"` becomes `pretwo words`.
- Nothing expands and no command runs. Characters such as `$`, `*`, `~`, `#`, `|`, `>`, `;`, and `&` are ordinary text.

An unfinished quote stops Build with an **Arguments** problem naming the column where that quote opened.

For a program named `./main`, entering `hello "two words" '' a\ b` produces `argc = 5`:

| Index     | String          |
| --------- | --------------- |
| `argv[0]` | `./main`        |
| `argv[1]` | `hello`         |
| `argv[2]` | `two words`     |
| `argv[3]` | An empty string |
| `argv[4]` | `a b`           |

### Access from assembly and C/C++

The program starts with `$a0` = `argc`, the count of all strings, and `$a1` = `argv`, the address of an array of pointers to them. Each string is UTF-8 with a terminating NUL; `argv[argc]` is a null pointer ending the array. `argv[0]` is the program name: `./` plus the Entry path without its final extension (`./main` for `main.asm`), or the C or C++ source path without its final extension for a compiled program (`./main` for `main.c`). User Arguments begin at `argv[1]`, so `argc` is at least 1.

Pointers are 4 bytes. To print the first user argument with the print-string service, perform these operations in order:

| Operation                                       | Instructions                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Skip the load if `argc < 2`                     | `sltiu $t0, $a0, 2`, then `bne $t0, $zero, no_argument`, then `nop` |
| Load the pointer in `argv[1]`                   | `lw $a0, 4($a1)`                                                    |
| Print the NUL-terminated string at that pointer | `li $v0, 4`, then `syscall`                                         |

`no_argument` is a label you supply for the case with no user argument. Loading the pointer into `$a0` replaces the count, so save `argc` and `argv` first if you need them after this service call.

For C or C++, declare `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`. Check `argc > 1` before using `argv[1]`; for example, `if (argc > 1) printf("%s\n", argv[1]);` prints the first user argument when `<stdio.h>` is included. See the [Runtime library](/documentation/mips/runtime-library#compiled-programs) for startup and function support.

### Memory layout and limits

The strings and pointer array occupy the **Arguments** memory region above the stack, below `0x7FFFFFFC`. `$sp` keeps its initial value, `0x7FFFEFFC`. The memory view labels the array `argv` and the strings `argv[0]`, `argv[1]`, … . With the program name `./main` and Arguments `hello "two words"`, `argc` is 3:

| Item                           | Value        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `$a0` (`argc`)                 | `3`          |
| `$a1` (address of `argv`)      | `0x7FFFFFD4` |
| `argv[1]` (address of `hello`) | `0x7FFFFFEC` |

Undo back to the start keeps these initial arguments. A Testcase's starting registers are applied afterwards, so overriding the argument registers replaces the supplied count or array address.

The Arguments field may contain at most 1,024 arguments, excluding `argv[0]`. The entire stored block may use at most 4,080 bytes. That total includes the program name and argument strings as UTF-8 bytes, one terminating NUL byte per string, one pointer per string, the final null pointer, and padding to align the pointer array. Pointers use 4 bytes and alignment padding uses 0–3 bytes. A string cannot contain a NUL character. Build stops with an Arguments problem if the count or storage limit is exceeded.

When porting code from **MARS**, another MIPS simulator, account for its different argument layout: MARS omits the program name, starts `argv` with the first user argument, and places `argc` and the pointers below the stack, lowering `$sp`. In this editor, keep the program-name slot and use the starting `$a0` and `$a1` described above.
